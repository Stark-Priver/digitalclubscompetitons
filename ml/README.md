# Dropa ML Pipeline

This folder contains machine learning code and notebooks for delivery time prediction, anomaly detection, and time-series forecasting.

## Structure

- `notebooks/` : Jupyter notebooks for experiments and model development
- `src/` : Python scripts for data processing, training, and inference
- `requirements.txt` : ML dependencies
- `data/` : Link to main data folder

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Launch Jupyter:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
3. Use notebooks in `notebooks/` for model development.

## Main Tasks

- Delivery ETA prediction
- Anomaly detection
- Time-series forecasting
- RAG chatbot embeddings

## Data

Use the CSV files in the main `data/` folder.
